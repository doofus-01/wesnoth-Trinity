            story= _ "The voyage up the river was fairly uneventful, if somewhat exhausting for those who had to man the oars.  But then, in the early, dark hours of the morning, the water developed a strange current, and the air a strange wind, which slammed the ship into the rocks and shallows.  Haldrad heard the sharp cracking of breaking beams, then he was pitched into the water.  After he pulled himself to shore, he saw the ship was destroyed, but there didn't seem to be many injured.  If they were lucky, the ship would be then only casualty."
