It was getting dark, and Carcyn was the last sizeable town until Dan Tonk, so the Prince's train headed in to rent a floor of the town inn."

            #    Haldrad's bodyguards moved in to strike down the diseased old man before he harmed their charge, but the Prince raised a hand, tossed a coin, and asked:"

            'My brother went in to town and did not come back.  The militia will not let me past the gates, so I cannot follow him.  I am blind, and without his guidance I am lost.'
            The old man was quite dirty and smelled like Death.  As often happens with his type, it seemed he never changed cloths, only added new ones so that he had acquired quite a putrid bulk of cloth.  And yet, there was something upright and noble in his posture.  Prince Haldrad felt there was something interesting about this old man.  'Come with us, old father.  At the inn, you can wash up and then we will find your brother.'"
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The Prince and his guard rented the entire second floor of the inn. He showed the old beggar a room, gave him some clean clothes, and told him to clean up and that he would be back in a few hours and they would find his brother. The Prince went back downstairs to join his companions in a meal and a few drinks.
            The wine tasted watered down, but it must have been augmented for the next few hours flew by.  He woke from the warmth of a friendly barmaid to the cries of 'Kill him!' emmanating from the street outside.  Haldrad staggerd to his feet, and joined his guards at the window to see the commotion."

        [part]
            story= _ "The Prince saw he had been mistaken about the bulk of clothes, for one of the old man's sleeves had been ripped, revealing a muscular blue/grey forearm more remeniscent of a troll than an old man. Haldrad felt the barmaid's body tense with hostility as she squeezed through to get a spot at the window. 'Another one!' she hissed 'The first one came in here, asking questions about magical gems or some such nonsense. When the old sot Pops Garah took a swing at him and knocked off his hood, we got to see him for what he was.'
            Haldrad and his guard ran outside to gain control of the situation."
