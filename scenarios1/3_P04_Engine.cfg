A brief ceremony caused the hall and the gems on the altar to glow with an unnatural blue light.  Nemesis explained that the gems formed a map, indicating the status of other godly installations.  Most gems were faint, indicating a loss, but some were strong blue indicating they were intact but dormant. Four were glowing white, indicating activity. The center white gem represented the one in which Nemesis stood. Two of the others probably represented the chambers that had until recently housed Athanta, Ares, and herself."
