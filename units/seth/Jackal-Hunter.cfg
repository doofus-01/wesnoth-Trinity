    description= _ "The land around the Old Kingdom was a dry desert, it may have protected the kingdom in its early years.  One of the dangers of the desert was a large-eared, pack hunter, jackal-like beast.

As the Destroyer moved in to crush the Old Kingdom, it used this historical menace as a cloak for its assault forces."
